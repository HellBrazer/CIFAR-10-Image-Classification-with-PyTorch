# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch
This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook covers the entire process, from loading and normalizing the data to defining, training, and testing the network, and finally evaluating the performance on individual classes.
