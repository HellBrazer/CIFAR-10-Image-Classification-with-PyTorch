# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch
This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook covers the entire process, from loading and normalizing the data to defining, training, and testing the network, and finally evaluating the performance on individual classes.

## Project Structure

- `Pytorch - CIFAR10.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for the CIFAR-10 image classification project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch library (`torch`, `torchvision`)
- Matplotlib library (`matplotlib`)
- NumPy library (`numpy`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
